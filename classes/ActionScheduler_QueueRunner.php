     * This method is attached to 'shutdown', so is called frequently. To avoid slowing down
     * the site, it mitigates the work performed in each request by:
     * 1. checking if it's in the admin context and then
     * 2. haven't run on the 'shutdown' hook within the lock time (60 seconds by default)
     * 3. haven't exceeded the number of allowed batches.
     *
     * The order of these checks is important, because they run from a check on a value:
     * 1. in memory - is_admin() maps to $GLOBALS or the WP_ADMIN constant
     * 2. in memory - transients use autoloaded options by default
     * 3. from a database query - has_maximum_concurrent_batches() run the query
     *    $this->store->get_claim_count() to find the current number of claims in the DB.
     *
     * If all of these conditions are met, then we request an async runner check whether it
     * should dispatch a request to process pending actions.
